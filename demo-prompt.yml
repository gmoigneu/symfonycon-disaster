Hey Jean-Claude. I need you to create a new endpoint /mcp that will be use by AI clients. First create a new branch called mcpserver. Symfony AI and MCP packages are already installed and configured in Symfony. Don't use any other package or library. You need to develop a MCP server capable of helping users to query the global disasters database. We want to have tools available that match the main controller of our web application. Like disasters per year and per country.But also a query tool that will take the query as language and use Claude to generate an actual query to the database. So you will need to make sure Claude knows the database schema and the main entities. Obviously this query tool should be read-only and would not allow to write, update or delete data. Develop this full mcp server as a Streamable HTTP one. The Anthropic API key for that natural language to SQL generation is in the .env file and already configured in Symfony. Once done, push your changes to the branch on Upsun and activate the environment. Don't wait for the deployment to complete and give me the URL of the mcp endpoint to test it.
